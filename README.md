# MinesweeperAI-Server

## This MATLAB program solves the MineSweeper game using artificial neural networks.

To use the program: 
1) Play the python game found at: https://github.com/arbel03/MinesweeperAI-Clientâ€¨
2) Fetch the recorded data from ```data_file.txt```
3) Run the python script ```convertor.py``` while the fetched data is stored at ```input_data.txt```
4) Now the data is parsed and MALAB can interpret it. Run ```Net.m``` to run and train the network.
